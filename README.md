# FishBirdEyeVisualSLAM

FishBirdEyeVisualSLAM is a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system designed for autonomous driving applications. It leverages data from a forward-facing fisheye camera on a moving vehicle and a virtual bird view to construct an overhead view of the environment.


## Features

- **Wide Field of View**: The repository is for a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that utilizes both a front mono and a bird's eye view, providing a comprehensive perspective for autonomous driving applications.
- **Robust Localization**: The system is capable of building a local map for the bird's eye view for improved matching and inliers. It also implements a lost and re-initialization functionality, enhancing the robustness of the system in dynamic environments.
- **Detailed Mapping**: Constructs a detailed overhead map of the environment, facilitating navigation and decision-making for autonomous driving systems.
- **Real-time Performance**: Designed for real-time operation, ensuring timely updates of localization and mapping information.
