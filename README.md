# FishBirdEyeVisualSLAM

FishBirdEyeVisualSLAM is a Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that leverages the data from both a forward-facing fisheye camera on a moving vehicle and virtual bird view to construct an overhead view of the environment. This system is designed to play a crucial role in autonomous driving applications, providing robust visual localization and mapping capabilities.

## Features

- **Wide Field of View**: Utilizes a fisheye camera to capture a wide field of view around the vehicle, minimizing blind spots and enhancing safety.
- **Robust Localization**: Implements advanced algorithms for robust visual localization in various environmental conditions.
- **Detailed Mapping**: Constructs a detailed overhead map of the environment, facilitating navigation and decision-making for autonomous driving systems.
- **Real-time Performance**: Designed for real-time operation, ensuring timely updates of localization and mapping information.
